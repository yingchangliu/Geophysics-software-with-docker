Install Madagascar on ubuntu:18.04 docker image.

I use the openSUSE Tumbleweed version, but it is troublesome to configure dependencies, so I chose to use docker to implement it. Since it has been implemented to run the GUI on docker before, this is very practical.

It is very easy, just reproduce the official website ( http://www.ahay.org/ ) tutorial.
