Install Madagascar on ubuntu:18.04 docker image.

I use the openSUSE Tumbleweed and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), but it is troublesome to configure dependencies, so I choose to use docker. Since it has been implemented to run the GUI on docker before, this is very practical.

It is very easy, just reproduce the official website ( http://www.ahay.org/ ) tutorial.
